===========================
Writing boolean expressions
===========================

The grammar supported by boolrule is fairly simple but powerful.


Whitespace
==========

Except within string literals, all whitespace is ignored.

Literals
========

Numeric literls are written as bare numbers. Floating point and exponent-based
numbers are supported::

 10       # int
 -10      # int with optional sign
 10.5     # float (without optional sign)
 10.5E-3  # equivalent to 0.0105

String literls can be single or double quoted::

 "Hello, world"
 'boolrule rulez"

Boolean literals are the bare values ``true`` and ``false``

``None`` type is the bare value ``none``

Property paths
==============

In order to reference values from the context passed into the ``test()``
method you specify the path to the property as a dot-separated identifier::

 foo
 foo.bar
 foo.bar.baz

At evaluation time, these will map to either object attributes or dict keys in
that order.


Basic comparison operators
==========================

===============================  ========================  =====================
Operator                         Description               Example
===============================  ========================  =====================
``=``, ``==``, ``eq``            Equality                  ``foo == 5``
``!=``, ``!==``, ``ne``, ``≠``   Inequality                ``bar != 5``
``>``, ``gt``                    Greater than              ``foo > 5``
``>=``, ``ge``, ``≥``            Greater than or equal to  ``foo >= 5``
``<``, ``lt``                    Less than                 ``foo < 5``
``<=``, ``le``, ``≤``            Less than or equal to     ``foo <= 5``
``is``                           Identity                  ``foo is True``
``isnot``                        Inverse identity          ``foobar isnot True``
===============================  ========================  =====================


Logical operators
=================

=======================  ========================  =========================
Operator                 Description               Example
=======================  ========================  =========================
``and``                  Logical and               ``foo == 5 and bar < 10``
``or``                   Logical or                ``bar == 5 or bar < 10``
=======================  ========================  =========================


Set operators
====================

=======================  ========================  =========================
Operator                 Description               Example
=======================  ========================  =========================
``in``, ``∈``            Is a member of            ``foo in ("a","b","c")``
``notin``, ``∉``         Is not a member of        ``foo not in ("a","b")``
``⊆``                    Is a subset of            ``foo ⊆ ("a", "b", "c")``
``⊇``                    Is a superset of          ``foo ⊇ ("a", "b")``
``∩``                    Intersects                ``foo ∩ ("a", "b")``
=======================  ========================  =========================


Nested expressions
==================

You can use parentheses to next expressions::

 foo > 5 and (10 < bar or bar > 20)
